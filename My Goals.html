    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Why do I want to learn this skill?</strong></p></li>
        I think it means that I'm doing what I always wanted to do and what I originally loved, but never took a shot at it. 
        My motivations are happiness. I don't feel like I have to prove anything except to myself that I can make my ideas and dreams into a reality.
        <li><p><strong>What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</strong></p></li>
        I can be able to achieve a job in the world of CS. I will be able to be more flexible in doing what I want and learning more and
        more to help me make what I want to make on my own.
        <li><p><strong>How will this skill change my life and my career?</strong></p></li>
        I think I'm able to motivate my peers and others who went down one path and no matter how "late" it is never late to
        switch what you want to do because we all change in life.
        <li><p><strong>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and coworkers?</strong></p></li>
        I think it will be frowned upon at first because my whole life has been focused on becoming a doctor.
        But I know it should pass over once I work really hard at it. 
        <li><p><strong>How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</strong></p></li>
        I will feel very happy. I think to a certain extent I will feel like I missed out, but I'm happy I went
        down one path and realized its not me and glad I'm changing it now to explore my options in what I want to do
        in life.
        <li><p><strong>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</strong></p></li>
        I think life would look like how I wanted it. Living it and happy doing what I'm doing.

    </ol>
